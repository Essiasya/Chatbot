# Main steps :
## 1 ) Implementation of a Contextual Chatbot in PyTorch.
The implementation is straightforward with a Feed Forward Neural net with 2 hidden layers.The customization for your own use case is super easy. Just modify intents.json with possible patterns and responses and re-run the training 
The approach is inspired by this article and ported to PyTorch: https://chatbotsmagazine.com/contextual-chat-bots-with-tensorflow-4391749d0077.
